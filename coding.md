### Account management application using USSD.

In this tutorial we will create a simple account management system using USSD.
The user will be able to dial a USSD code and access their account balance and other information.
## Introduction
USSD(Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) is a means of communication used
 to send text and receive feedback from a user. The user dials a USSD code and
 gets a specified response from the owner of the code.

In order to build a USSD app you will need:

1. A USSD code (This is how the app is made available to the public)
2. A callback URL (Its through this url that the MNO is able to complete
 the communication between the user and the app)
3. Basic Python üêç knowledge, basic django knowledge, as the framework
we will use on this app is build based on Django, which is based on python.
You can proceed without reading both the above, in case you can read Python code

## PREAMBLE

Let‚Äôs assume we hold user info and we would like them to access it via USSD.
We will build a simple USSD menu that asks users to enter `1` to view their
account and `2` to view their phone number. On the accounts page, they can
enter `1` for the account number or `2` for the account balance.

## Start of coding.

As a general practise, django and python applications are built in a virtual environment.
A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate.
This project is initialized with Django, Lets add an application. I encourage you to create one for yourself.
I avoid adding the documents for it here as its out of the scope of this tutorial.

To add a django app;

    python manage.py startapp core


Next, we add dependecies that we require to complete this app.

1. [Ussd Airflow](https://django-ussd-airflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html)
   This module will simplify our work by;
    1. Handling USSD sessions
    2. Processing users input
    3. Serving the right response to the user.

    New terms:
    What is a session in respect to USSD. A session is a unique timed period, where a user can
    interact with a USSD application. This interaction means  a specified flow or journey which
    a customer follows to get value out of the application.

    User input: Is the user response as they use the USSD application, eg, we ask the user what info
    he needs, `1` for account balance or `2` for phone number. User responds with `1` for account
    balance. This is the user input.

    Serving response to user.
    After user selects `1` for account balance, the app echoes his account balance, this process is what is referred
    to as serving response to user in this tutorial.

To add ussd_airflow, we add this change in the requirements.txt file.

    'ussd_airflow'
Because ussd_airflow is a django app, we add ussd_airflow in the settings file, to make django load it,
as follows.
Edit `UssdIntroduction/settings.py` and make this change in the INSTALLED_APPS section, to look as this.

        INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'ussd.apps.UssdConfig',
    'core'
]
 Notice we have add 'ussd.apps.UssdConfig' and 'core'.

 With the above change, lets proceed to the next stage.

 The MNO will make requests to our application, and we shall respond with a response to be
 displayed to the user.
 This means we need to expose an endpoint that the mno can make standard HTTP requests to.

 Lets do this.
