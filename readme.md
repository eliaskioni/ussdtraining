### Introduction to USSD

Every time you dial *XYZ# to check the airtime balance on your phone,
you are using a decades old technology standard called USSD. Its this standard
that we are going to cover in this amateur tutorial.
USSD stands for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data.  USSD works on every phone, especially
in the African Continent making it valuable.

This document, [GSM 02.90](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gts/02/0290/05.01.00_60/gsmts_0290v050100p.pdf), covers the
 protocol designed for technical communications between a mobile network operator’s computers and it’s subscribers handsets.

 USSD’s simplicity is what makes it so powerful, as all phones can easily support it without the
 processing hardware demanded by smart phones platforms such as Android and iOS.

 The continent has about 18% Internet penetration but over 80% mobile penetration.
 This 80% that are connected on mobile represent over 960 million people who have phones.

These people have real lives and real problems, and USSD developers build apps to solve these problems.

Original USSD applications were built and run by the network operators and worked as this:

 With the advent of the Internet, and a lot of technology innovations that have happened in between
 now and then, USSD now typically works like this:

 The best part about USSD apps is that they don’t need to be installed, compared to other mobile apps,
 because they run on the network, not the device.

So the moment a USSD app is deployed to a network, it’s instantly available to every subscriber; as evidenced by
our live products in Ivory Coast, Rwanda and my favourite, Riziki in Kenya.
